Let's deploy this cyber contract Anon punk
<br />
<br />
<br />
In a dystopian future, a cyberpunk artist creates a unique NFT masterpiece. However, under the Harberger Tax system, they must continuously pay a tax on its value or risk losing ownership. 
<br />
As demand for the artwork soars, the artist fights against oppressive corporations, utilizing their creativity as a weapon. Through underground networks and crypto-anarchist allies, they navigate the digital shadows, determined to reclaim control over their creation. 
<br />
The Harberger Tax becomes a symbol of resistance, fueling a rebellion against a world where art is commodified, and the artist's struggle becomes a catalyst for societal change.
